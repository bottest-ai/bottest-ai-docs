<Steps>
### Create a bottest.ai account
If you haven't already, [create an account](https://bottest.ai/sign-up)
or [log in](https://bottest.ai/sign-in) to bottest.ai to make sure you are authenticated.

### Download the Chrome Extension
All Tests are recorded in the browser using the bottest.ai Chrome Extension. You can download the
extension [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bottestai/pagedbefhikbkdlkmhfohdlafjkielln).

It's recommended to pin the bottest.ai Chrome Extension for easy access:

    width={1440}
    height={960}
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px", border: "2px dashed #388AEB" }}
/>

When you open the extension you should see the following:
<Image

    alt="Image"
    width={1440}
    height={960}
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px", border: "2px dashed #388AEB" }}
/>

### Record a Test

1. First, open the webpage where your chatbot is located (ie: a [customGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-VWc8jWpsp-luxwatch-vault-customer-service-bot))
Then, open the bottest.ai extension. After clicking "Let's Go" on the initial welcome page, you should see the below screen.
Double check that the tab you are currently on is the correct one with your chatbot's interface. If so,
click "I'm on my chatbot's website" and go to the next step.

    width={1440}
    height={960}
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px", border: "2px dashed #388AEB" }}
/>

2. Press the "Record" button, and then start sending messages to your chatbot. The questions you ask
your chatbot will be stored as the prompts for the Test, and the answers that
the chatbot gives will be stored as a Baseline to compare future responses against.

    width={1440}
    height={960}
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px", border: "2px dashed #388AEB" }}
/>

*bottest.ai will never
record your interactions outside of this Test recording state, or without your
permission. Please visit our [Privacy Policy](https://bottest.ai/privacy-policy) and
[Terms of Service](https://bottest.ai/terms-of-service) for more information on
how we use your data.*

3. When you have finished your conversation, re-open the Chrome Extension and press the
"Stop Recording" button. You can then name your newly recorded Test. If you want to
re-record your Test, press the "Cancel" button to delete your recording.

    width={1440}
    height={960}
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px", border: "2px dashed #388AEB" }}
/>


### Replay the Test
After creating your Test, you'll be instructed to run it. After you press the "Run Test" button
on the extension, a new tab will open and your questions are re-asked to the chatbot.
The new responses your chatbot gives will be sent to bottest.ai and compared against the
original recorded (Baseline) responses.

    alt="Image"
    width={1440}
    height={960}
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px", border: "2px dashed #388AEB" }}
/>


Once the extension finished replaying the Test, you'll see the following message onscreen. You can
then open the extension and view your results in the extension Dashboard.

<Image
    src="/assets/quickstart-tutorial/replay-finished.png"
    alt="Image"
    width={1440}
    height={960}
    style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto", borderRadius: "20px", marginTop: "20px", marginBottom: "10px", border: "2px dashed #388AEB" }}
/>


### Review the results
When first opening the bottest.ai Chrome Extension Dashboard, there will be a Product Tour to help get
you oriented with the UI. The bottest.ai Chrome Extension Dashboard enables you to Create new Tests, Run Tests,
and view Pass/Fail Results.

You should see in the Dashboard that your Test is listed with a status next to it.

<StyledImage path="/assets/quickstart-tutorial/2.svg" />

*If the status still says "Running,"
it's because the chatbot responses are still being evaluated and compared against the Baseline. This may take
a few seconds depending on the length of the conversation*.


</Steps>

Congratulations! You've successfully created and run your first Test!

### Next Steps
