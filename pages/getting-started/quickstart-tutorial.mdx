or [log in](https://bottest.ai/sign-in) to bottest.ai to make sure you are authenticated.

### Download the Chrome Extension
All Tests are recorded in the browser using the bottest.ai Chrome Extension. You can download the
extension [here]().

### Record a Test
Follow the instructions displayed on the Chrome Extension:

1. Navigate to the website where your chatbot is located,
then press the button that says "I'm on my chatbot's website."

2. Press the "Start Recording" button to start recording your interactions with the
webpage, then begin having your conversation with the chatbot. The questions you ask
your chatbot will be stored as the prompts when running the Test, and the answers that
the chatbot gives will be stored as a Baseline to compare future responses against.

*bottest.ai will never
record your interactions outside of this Test Recording state, or without your
 permission. Please visit our [Privacy Policy](https://bottest.ai/privacy-policy) and
[Terms of Service](https://bottest.ai/terms-of-service) for more information on
how we use your data.*

3. When you have finished your conversation, re-open the Chrome Extension and press the
"Stop Recording" button. You can then name your newly recorded Test.
If you want to re-record your Test, press the "Cancel" button. Once you're happy with
your recorded Test, go to the next step.

### Replay the Test
Press the "Run Test" button on the extension, and watch as a new tab is opened and
your questions are re-asked to the chatbot. The new responses your chatbot gives will
be sent to bottest.ai and compared against the original recorded (Baseline) responses.

You can reopen the extension to check if the Test is still running, or if it has completed.
Once the Test is finished running, you should see the below screen. Click "Take me
to my dashboard" to visit the bottest.ai Chrome Extension Dashboard and proceed to the next step.

### Review the results
When first opening the bottest.ai Chrome Extension Dashboard, there will be a Product Tour to help get
you oriented with the UI. The bottest.ai Chrome Extension Dashboard enables you to Create new Tests, Run Tests,
and view Pass/Fail Results.

You should see in the Dashboard that your Test is listed with a status next to it.

*If the status still says "Running,"
it's because the chatbot responses are still being evaluated and compared against the Baseline. This may take
a few minutes depending on the length of the conversation*.


</Steps>

Congratulations! You've successfully created and run your first Test!
