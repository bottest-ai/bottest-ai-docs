This guide will go over understanding what a Test is and how a Test relates to the other bottest.ai concepts.

At its core, a Test represents **a single specific scenario you want your chatbot to be able to handle correctly**.
A Test can be thought of as the semantic meaning behind a request or series of prompts. A Test is more than a sequence
of specific prompts, since there are practically unlimited ways to phrase the same question.

For example, a single Test might be asking your chatbot how to initiate a refund, and then having
follow-up questions regarding the specifics of an order. There are many syntactically different
ways to ask each of those prompts with the same semantic meaning, but they would all fit under
a single Test, possibly named "Initiate a Refund." The specifics on how those questions were
asked would be specified at the [Variant level](/core-concepts/variants).

When Tests are executed they create [Test Runs](/core-concepts/test-runs), regardless of whether they were ran
as a [Suite Run](/core-concepts/suite-runs) or individually.
