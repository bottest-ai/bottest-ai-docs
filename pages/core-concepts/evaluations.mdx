This guide will go over understanding what an Evaluation is and how an Evaluation relates to the other
bottest.ai concepts.

At its core, an Evaluation represents **a determination by the bottest.ai Test Evaluator whether
responses in a specific, unique conversation match at least one Baseline.** This is the smallest granularity
for testing, and each Evaluation is either a Pass or a Fail.

When a conversation is being evaluated, the Test's Success Criteria is used to determine the Pass or Fail.

The number of Evaluations that will run for a specific Test depends on two factors:
1. The number of Variants defined for the Test
1. The number of iterations defined in the Test (the number of times each Variant will
be ran). Multiple iterations are performed of each Variant to measure the consistency
in responses provided by the Bot.

  Generally, LLMs are nondeterministic, and prompting the same questions will give different answers.
  In this case, setting multiple iterations will help ensure consistency across the same conversation
  for your Bot.
</Callout>

For example, If you have 1 Test with 3 Variants and you set the iteration count to 2,
bottest.ai would perform 6 Evaluations for that Test. Each resulting conversation
would have different responses from the Bot, and would need to be evaluated:

1. Variant A - Iteration 1
2. Variant A - Iteration 2
3. Variant B - Iteration 1
4. Variant B - Iteration 2
5. Variant C - Iteration 1
6. Variant C - Iteration 2
