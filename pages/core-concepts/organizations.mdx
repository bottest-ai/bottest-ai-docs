This guide will go over understanding what a bottest.ai Organization and User is.

At its core, an Organization is a **group of bottest.ai users that want to share access to Bots, Suites,
Tests, etc**.

When you first setup your bottest.ai account, you won't be a part of any Organization. You can create
Bots, Suites, Tests, etc just as a single user, but you won't be able to share this data with anyone else.

With the appropriate billing tier, you can [create an Organization](/tutorials/create-an-organization),
[invite others](/tutorials/invite-to-an-organization) and manage the users in the Organization. You can
create Bots, Suites, Tests, etc under this Organization.

There are three levels of permission for an Organization:
1. **Admin**. This permission has full access to the Organization, including inviting others to join, management
of the user roles, deletion of the organization and full testing capabilities (create, delete, edit, run
Tests/Suites/Environments). This is the only role that can create new Bots for the Organization.

2. **Editor**. This permission has full testing capabilities for all of the Organiation Bots. This means they
can create new Tests/Suites/Environments, edit or delete existing ones, and run Tests or Suites.

3. **Viewer**. This permission has limited testing capabilities for all of the Organization Bots. This means they
can only view and run Tests or Suites, but cannot modify/delete or create new Test/Suites/Environments.
