This guide will go over understanding what a Suite Run is and how a Suite Run relates to the other
bottest.ai concepts.

At its core, a Suite Run represents **the combined execution of all Tests within a Suite,
including each Test's multiple Variants and iterations**. Similar to a Test Run,
a Suite Run can have the following statuses:

1. **Pass**: All Test Runs in the Suite Run received a Pass. This means all Evaluations passed.
2. **Fail**: All Test Runs in the Suite Run received a Fail. This means all Evaluations failed.
3. **Mixed**: The Test Runs in the Suite Run have a mixture of Pass, Fail, Mixed, or other statuses.
3. **Running**: The Suite Run is currently running (or the results are still being parsed/evaluated)
4. **Stopped**: The Suite Run was stopped manually before completing.
5. **Error**: The Suite Run was stopped due to one or more errors during execution or evaluation.
