This guide will go over understanding what a Variant is and how a Variant relates to the other bottest.ai
concepts.

At its core, a Variant represents **a unique variation or instantiation of a Test's prompts**. There are
many slightly different ways that a user can ask the same question or series of questions. A Variant is
a single variation of those many possibilites. Variants allow you to ensure that your Bot correctly
answers when it is presented with different phrasing ([small changes in prompts can cause large differences
in responses from LLMs](https://arxiv.org/html/2401.03729v2)).

For example, let's say your original recorded conversation is:

`User: What is the status of my order?`

`Bot: ...`

`User: My order number is #23051039 and the email is joner@example.com`

`Bot: ...`

If you were to generate 5 Variants of the original recording, you might get the following:

<Tabs items={['Variant 1', 'Variant 2', 'Variant 3', 'Variant 4', 'Variant 5']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    `User: Can you give me an update on my order?`

    `Bot: ...`

    `User: The order number is #23051039, and the email is joner@example.com.`

    `Bot: ...`
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    `User: Whatâ€™s happening with my order right now?`

    `Bot: ...`

    `User: My order number is #23051039, and my email that's associated with it is joner@example.com.`

    `Bot: ...`
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    `User: Could you tell me the current status of my order?`

    `Bot: ...`

    `User: The order number is #23051039, and my email address is joner@example.com.`

    `Bot: ...`
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    `User: I need to check the status of my order. Can you help?`

    `Bot: ...`

    `User: The order number is #23051039, and the email used for the order is joner@example.com.`

    `Bot: ...`
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    `User: What's the status of my order, please?`

    `Bot: ...`

    `User: Order number: #23051039, email: joner@example.com.`

    `Bot: ...`
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
