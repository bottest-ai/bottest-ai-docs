This guide will go over understanding what a bottest.ai Suite is and how a Suite relates
to the other bottest.ai concepts.

At its core, a Suite represents **a group of Tests that are similar and would want to be grouped or
organized together**. A Suite can be thought of as a folder within a file system, grouping together
Tests that should be categorized together.

<FileTree>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Billing Suite" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="Understand Current Bill" />
        <FileTree.File name="Payment Options Availible" />
        <FileTree.File name="Latest Invoice Charge" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Product Suite" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="Key Features" />
        <FileTree.File name="Setup and Usage" />
        <FileTree.File name="Troubleshooting Tips" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="Pricing Suite" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="Cost of Premium Subscription" />
        <FileTree.File name="Availible Discounts" />
        <FileTree.File name="Explain Pricing Tiers" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

All Tests in a Suite will be ran together (during [Suite Runs](/core-concepts/suite-runs)),
so it's best to organize Tests into Suites that assess a specific aspect of your Bot.
