bottest.ai is a feature-rich chatbot testing platform that enables
teams to develop their AI-based chatbots with confidence in its
quality, reliability, performance, and safety.

By using bottest.ai, teams save countless hours each week automating their
testing procedures. Instead of spending time copy and pasting the prompts from spreadsheet
to chatroom after each change in the AI, teams can focus on what matters:
building and improving their product.

User queries, expected results, actual results, detailed diagnoses on failures,
and important analytics are stored all in one platform for your team. Whether
your team is working with one AI-chatbot or a collection of them, you'll understand
how your chatbot(s) are performing and exactly where they are lacking.

Developing and scaling an AI chatbot is difficult without the right testing tools. Teams will often
develop their own makeshift tools and processes to alleviate the unique challenges that break traditional
software testing paradigms:

- **Language based responses are subjective and non-deterministic.** Unlike traditional software testing, where
you have an input with a determined expected output, responses from a chatbot need to be graded based on semantic
meaning.
- **Upgrades or improvements in the AI can cause unforseen issues elsewhere.** Each change to the underlying LLM or AI model may improve
the quality of answers on some questions, but cause quality degredation on other prompts. It's practically
impossible to develop a high quality AI chatbot without some level of regression testing.
- **The subject matter experts often aren't the ones maintaining the code.** The people in your team
who can best determine how the chatbot should perform are rarely the same engineers working on maintaining
the tests.

bottest.ai addresses each of these unique challenges with a suite of features to bring your chatbot's
quality, performance, and safety to the next level. Our **AI-powered Evaluation Engine** detects changes in
the content and tone of responses, and allows for complete customization of how Tests should be passed or failed.
Have confidence in your chatbot's reliability with our full **Suite Test Runs**, and understand overall trends
and changes on an individual Test level with the automatically generated Suite Run Report. Setup, record, and
replay Tests all from the UI with **no code or technical experience needed**â€”so the subject matter experts can
be directly involved with the testing process.
