This guide will go over the basics of using the [bottest.ai Chrome Extension](),
including recording, running and viewing results of Tests. You can download the
Chrome Extension [here]().

## Viewing Tests
You can manage which Test will be shown in the Chrome Extension using the 3 dropdowns at the top.
To keep the Chrome Extension UI clean, these dropdowns will only be visible if you have more than
one Bot, Suite, or Environment to choose from.


## Recording Tests

The bottest.ai Chrome Extension is the only way to add/record new Tests. When first
downloading the extension, you will be onboarded with a tutorial on how to record
your first Test. After the tutorial, you will need to press the "Create new Test"
button and follow the on-screen instructions to record a conversation.

You have the option of naming and saving the Test after recording. The only way
to modify the Test configuration (such as the Success Criteria, Variants, etc.)
is through the bottest.ai Dashboard.

## Running Tests

### Test Runs

You can run Tests by pressing the "Play" button to the left of each Test name. Doing
so will open a new browser tab and begin replaying the conversation. Depending on the Test's
configured number of Variants and Iterations, multiple tabs may be opened. While a Test
is playing, you can press the "Stop" button to the left of the Test to stop the Test's
execution.

The Tests will execute automatically as long as Google Chrome stays open. You can close the
Chrome Extension or minimize Google Chrome altogether and the Tests will continue to execute
as normal in the background.

Upon a Test completing, the tab will automatically close. If the Test seems to be frozen, the
replay logic may be waiting an additional few seconds to ensure the chatbot has completely finished
responding. **You can always open the extension when on a replaying tab to view the current progress**:

A Test that is still running will show:

### Suite Runs

You can initiate a Suite Run in the bottest.ai Chrome Extension with the
"Run all Tests" button. This will execute all Tests in the Suite and Environment chosen
in the dropdowns.

If you have disabled a Test from being included in Suite Runs from the bottest.ai Dashboard,
it will be displayed as grayed out:

## Viewing Test Results

Next to each Test is the status of the most recent Test Run. Hovering over the colored circle
will provide the name of the status:

Changing the Environment in the dropdown will update the status displayed to show the most recent
Test Run status in that Environment.
