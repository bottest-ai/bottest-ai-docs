# Dashboard

import StyledImage from "../../components/styledImage";

This guide will go over the basics of using the [bottest.ai Dashboard](https://bottest.ai/app/dashboard), from running and editing Suites of Tests
to viewing and managing Test Run results. You can always navigate to the Dashboard by clicking "Dashboard"
in the menu on the left.

## Viewing Tests

You can manage which Tests will be shown in your Dashboard using 3 tools:
1. **Bot/Suite/Environment Dropdowns**. You can use these dropdowns to change which Tests are shown
in the Dashboard. Modifying the Environment won't change which Tests are shown, but it will change the
recent statuses to show the Test Run statuses for the selected Environment.

All Tests belong to a Suite, and all Suites belong to a Bot. If you're unsure how you should
organize your Tests into Suites and Bots, check out the documentation on
[Bots](/core-concepts/bots), [Suites](/core-concepts/suites), and [Environments](/core-concepts/environments).

2. **Filters**. You can use the pre-set filters to only display the Tests that match the criteria.
For the time being, there are only pre-set filters for each Status, however *custom filters and
additional customization options are coming soon*.

3. **Search**. You can use the search bar on the right to search for a specific Test by name.
Note that you can only search from the Tests shown under the selected Suite.

## Running Tests

You can run Tests in the Dashboard either individually (using the Run Test button to the right of a Test):

<StyledImage path="/assets/guides/dashboard/4.svg" />

Or you can run all Tests in the full Suite using the "Run all Tests" button. Tests that are disabled
from full Test Runs will not be ran during Suite Runs.

## Editing Tests

You can edit Tests in the Dashboard using the gear icon to the right of each Test:

<StyledImage path="/assets/guides/dashboard/6.svg" />

It will open a modal view in which you are able to modify the Test's fields.
You can click the "Custom" button to the right of "Suite's default" to override the Suite's customized
value and set a Test specific one. To understand what each of these options mean,
check out the documentation on [Tests](/core-concepts/tests).

In this view, you can also download Test Baselines, disable the Test from running in Suite Runs (these are
when you press the "Run all Test" button), and delete the Test.

## Creating Tests

You can't record Tests directly from the Dashboard, only from the [bottest.ai Chrome Extension](/guides/chrome-extension) (this is
because bottest.ai webpage doesn't have access to data from other browser tabs).

However, there is a button that will conveniently open up the extension and bring you right to the
recording screen (as long as you have the bottest.ai Chrome Extension downloaded):

For specific information on what you can do from the bottest.ai Chrome Extension, visit the
[corresponding Guide section](/guides/chrome-extension). To get a walkthrough on how to record
new Tests, visit the tutorial on how to [Record a Test](/tutorials/record-a-test).
