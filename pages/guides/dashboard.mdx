This guide will go over the basics of using the [bottest.ai Dashboard](https://bottest.ai/app/dashboard), from running and editing Suites of Tests
to viewing and managing Test Run results. You can always navigate to the Dashboard by clicking "Dashboard"
in the menu on the left.

## Managing Tests

You can manage which Tests will be shown in your Dashboard using 3 tools:
1. **Bot/Suite/Environment Dropdowns**. You can use these dropdowns to change which Tests are shown
in the Dashboard. Modifying the Environment won't change which Tests are shown, but it will change the
recent statuses to show the Test Run statuses for the selected Environment.

All Tests belong to a Suite, and all Suites belong to a Bot. If you're unsure how you should
organize your Tests into Suites and Bots, check out the documentation on
[How to Organize your Data](/guides/how-to-organize-your-data).

2. **Filters**. You can use the pre-set filters to only display the Tests that match the criteria.
For the time being, there are only pre-set filters for each Status, however *custom filters and
additional customization options are coming soon*.

3. **Search**. You can use the search bar on the right to search for a specific Test by name.
Note that you can only search from the Tests shown under the selected Suite.
